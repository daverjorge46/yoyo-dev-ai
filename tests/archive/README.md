### Consciousness Framework Tests (Experimental)

**Location:** `tests/archive/consciousness/`

These tests were created for an experimental "consciousness framework" feature that was specced in `.yoyo-dev/specs/2025-12-05-conscious-agent-framework/` but not fully implemented.

**Reason for archiving:** The consciousness framework was an interesting experiment in agent behavior modification through prompt engineering, but the project decided to focus on the multi-agent orchestration system (v5.0) instead.

**Files:**
- `test_collaborative_language.py` - Tests for "we/our" collaborative language
- `test_consciousness_checks.py` - Tests for consciousness checkpoint blocks
- `test_identity_framework.py` - Tests for identity document loading
- `test_meta_cognitive_logging.py` - Tests for meta-cognitive logging
- `test_reflective_reasoning.py` - Tests for reflective reasoning patterns
- `test_session_continuity.py` - Tests for session continuity tracking

**Status:** Archived on 2025-12-29 during v5.0 documentation cleanup

**Future:** May be revisited if consciousness framework features are prioritized in future versions.
