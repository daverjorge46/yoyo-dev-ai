# Verify Documentation

**Purpose:** Verify all documentation is current and complete.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] README updated with new features (if applicable)
- [ ] API documentation updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Code comments present for complex logic
- [ ] Component props documented
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] Setup instructions current
- [ ] Breaking changes documented
- [ ] Migration guide provided (if needed)
- [ ] Inline JSDoc for public APIs
- [ ] Decision rationale recorded (if significant)

## Expected Outcome

All documentation is current, accurate, and complete.

## Error Handling

**If documentation incomplete:**
1. Document what's missing with specific sections
2. Provide content recommendations
3. Add to issues list in verification report
4. Minor documentation gaps can be fixed post-merge (non-blocking)
5. Critical documentation (breaking changes, security) blocks completion
